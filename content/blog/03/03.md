#### Life update
Change can be incredibly beneficial when it's in line with your values and 
goals, so I took the plunge! After dedicating 2.5 years to my internship, I 
decided it was time for a change, so I resigned. Consequently, I've put my 
robotics projects on pause for the time being. Instead, I'm focusing on 
building a solid portfolio over the next year, learning new skills along the 
way, and then diving into the job hunt. However, there's a bit of a challenge 
– the job market is overflowing with applicants, with over 1000 people applying 
for each position. Despite the tough competition, I'm confident in my abilities. 
That's why I made the decision to resign – I know I can find an even better 
job opportunity out there.

Two lessons I learned this week
- Forgot whatever happened yesterday. Now is a new start.
- Tweak your life a little bit & start looking it from a new perspective.

#### Project work
This week, I worked on two projects: a Snake game and an ASCII generator (which 
converts any JPEG image to ASCII art). While I'm pleased with my progress, 
there's still plenty of room for improvement in both projects.

#### Todo update
Last week, I managed to complete only 32% of my to-do list on average across 
the seven days. This week, I saw a slight improvement, reaching an average 
ompletion rate of 49%. Though it's not a significant jump, I'm committed to 
doing better. My aim for next week is to hit an average completion rate of 70%.
Here's how I did each day:
