#### Life update
This week, I haven't been very productive. Instead, I spent most of my time
being lazy and watching YouTube & Reddit all day. I'm
quite dissatisfied with my progress this week, as I aimed to achieve a
70% target, but my rate decreased by 5%. My activities mainly revolved
around adding new themes to my operating system and engaging in what's
technically termed "distro-hopping" â€” switching between multiple Linux
distributions until settling on Debian. From a learning perspective, I
focused on understanding TTY in Linux, how Linux processes function, and
IO redirection. While I didn't make progress towards my goals, I did enhance
my knowledge of operating systems.

#### Project work
This week, I didn't work on any projects, although I intended to build a
simple HTTP server, so I only managed to learn about the basics of Linux
socket programming, which is essential for constructing such an HTTP server
program.

#### Todo update
This week, my completion average over 7 days is 44%. I've just dropped from
49% to 44%, a 5% decrease. I'm really unhappy with this, but I will do better
next week.

Here's how I did each day:
