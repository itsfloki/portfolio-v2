Firstly, let me introduce myself. I am Abhijit a small-town boy who wants to 
build a robot. I don't know anything about robotics but I have a strong desire 
and some programming skills which I think I could use in this project. It's not 
a project it's Project K. Don't be confused with the movie called
[Kalki 2898 AD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalki_2898_AD). 

So why am I working on Project K? To answer this question I have to go in my 
childhood which I think will be a pretty boring stuff for you to read. So just 
hold on a bit and grab a coffe or tea whichever you preffer. Enough talking 
nonsense so since childhood I have the desier to build a robot which I could talk
to anytime as I have only 2 friends. Sometimes they are busy with their personal 
life so I need someone whome I could talk to and greet me when I came back home.

Also day by day I will become older and my memory will start to fade and then 
I will die with having so much regret. So there should be someone who could tell 
my small small stories, moments, adventures which I have experienced throught 
my life. I know I can just store these in videos or photos. But I want to tell 
my story through a person whom I can trust completly as robots are machine which 
can only do stuff which we tell them to do.

Every Sunday, I will share all my weekly progress through my blog. As life is 
unpreddictable anything can happen anytime. Although I have the confidence that 
I will not die until I finish this project.

I don't know if I can finish it or not but I will give my best and make this 
journy as much adventures as I can.
