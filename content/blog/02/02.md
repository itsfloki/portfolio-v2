I will be honest. This week I really haven't done anything I think. I mostly spend this week 
by watching movies & tv-shows. I have to stop this & other addictions. Although I have made some 
progress. Firstly I have re-read the 
[The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) book. 
Below are the projects I have built after reading the book.

#### Pomodoro Timer

#### Snake Game

Also I have finished the [basic electronics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-X9coYTOV4&list=PLah6faXAgguOeMUIxS22ZU4w5nDvCl5gs) course. Although I have skipped last few videos.

I know it's not a lot I have done this week. But my next week's target is to work on the below todos
- [Arduino course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ-LqeX_fLU)
- Build or add more features in existing projects
- Start learning assembly programming
