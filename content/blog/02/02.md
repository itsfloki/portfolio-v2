I'll be honest; this week, I haven't accomplished much. I spent 
most of my time watching movies and TV shows, a habit I recognize 
I need to break. Despite this, I've made some progress. Firstly, 
I've re-read 
[The C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language) book 
and completed the 
[basic electronics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-X9coYTOV4&list=PLah6faXAgguOeMUIxS22ZU4w5nDvCl5gs) 
course, although I did skip the last few videos. Here are the projects I've built after reading the c book

#### Pomodoro Timer

Below is my completion rate for this week's todo list, which I know is quite poor.

Moving forward, my goal for next week is to focus on the following tasks
- [Arduino course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJ-LqeX_fLU)
- Build or add more features in existing projects
- Start learning assembly programming
