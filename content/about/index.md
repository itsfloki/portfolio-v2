# About Me

Hi, I'm Abhijit, a passionate programmer currently pursuing my
bachelor's degree. When I'm not delving into the intricacies of coding,
you'll often find me enjoying my two other great loves - watching movies
and indulging in some thrilling cricket action. My life is all about
the perfect blend of bytes, blockbusters, and boundaries!
